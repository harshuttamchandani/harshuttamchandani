# 💫 About Me:
🚀 **Hi! I’m Harsh Uttamchandani**, a third-year B.Tech student in **Computer Science Engineering** at **VIT Bhopal**, with a growing passion for full-stack development and data structures.

💡 My coding journey began in class 6 when I first explored programming through creating a game in **SiMPLE**. This curiosity led me to explore **QBASIC** and later master **C++**. Currently, I am focused on full-stack development, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Despite challenges like an autoimmune disorder during my second year, I’ve stayed determined, continuing to learn and grow in the tech field.

💻 I’m always seeking new opportunities to collaborate, take on freelance projects, and explore internship roles in **software development**. Let's connect if you have an exciting project in mind!

🎨 When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing sports, especially **cricket** and **volleyball**, and delving into **psychology**.
